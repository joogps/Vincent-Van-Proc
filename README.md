Trying to create an animated version of The Starry Night using Processing.

### How can I make a custom drawing in it?
First of all, you want do delete my messy *.txt* files inside the *curves* folder in the *Reader* folder (lots of folders there). The *Writer.pde* sketch takes up a curve (you draw it with your mouse) and writes its coordinates it to a *.txt* file. This file should declare the color of the curve in the RGB format in its first line of text (values should be separated with commas and spaces). Once you have that file, you just need to put it inside the *curves* folder (which is inside the *Reader* folder), declare it in the *curves* array in *Reader.pde* and *voil√†*! You now have added your very first curve to the project! Wasn't it exciting? Anyway, since you found the process tedious, I'll tell you a hint that a little bird told me: you can create those coordinates *.txt* files while in *Reader.pde*! It's waaaay easier to do it that way because you can use preovious curves as reference points. Thank you for visiting my repo! (By the way, this was all made for an Arts class project... Yeah, you should now pretend you're surprised.)
